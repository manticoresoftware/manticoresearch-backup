Usage:
  manticore-backup --backup-dir=path/to/backup [OPTIONS]
--backup-dir=path/to/backup
  This is a path to the backup directory where a backup is stored.  The
  directory must exist. This argument is required and has no default value.
  On each backup run, it will create directory `backup-[datetime]` in the
  provided directory and will copy all required tables to it. So the backup-dir
  is a container of all your backups, and it's safe to run the script multiple
  times.
OPTIONS:
--config=path/to/manticore.conf
  Path to Manticore config. This is optional and in case it's not passed
  we use a default one for your operating system. It's used to get the host
  and port to talk with the Manticore daemon.
  You can use --config path1 --config path2 ... --config pathN
  to include all of the provided paths in the backup, but only
  the first one will be used for communication with the daemon.
--tables=table1,table2,...
  Semicolon-separated list of tables that you want to backup.
  If you want to backup all, just skip this argument. All the provided tables
  are supposed to exist in the Manticore instance you are backing up from,
  otherwise the backup will fail.
--compress
  Whether the backed up files should be compressed. Not by default.
--restore[=backup]
  Restore from --backup-dir. Just --restore lists available backups.
  --restore=backup will restore from <--backup-dir>/backup.
--force
  Skip versions check on restore and gracefully restore the backup.
--disable-telemetry
  Pass this flag in case you want to disable sending anonymized metrics  to Manticore. You can also use environment variable TELEMETRY=0.
--unlock
  In rare cases when something goes wrong the tables can be left in
  locked state. Using this argument you can unlock them.
--version
  Show the current version.
--help
  Show this help.
