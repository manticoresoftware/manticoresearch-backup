Usage:
manticore-backup --backup-dir=path/to/backup [OPTIONS]
--backup-dir=path/to/backup
This is a path to the backup directory where a backup is stored.  The
directory must exist. This argument is required and has no default value.
On each backup run, it will create directory `backup-[datetime]` in the
provided directory and will copy all required tables to it. So the backup-dir
is a container of all your backups, and it's safe to run the script multiple
times.
OPTIONS:
--config=path/to/manticore.conf
Path to Manticore config. This is optional and in case it's not passed
we use a default one for your operating system. It's used to get the host
and port to talk with the Manticore daemon.
You can use --config path1 --config path2 ... --config pathN
to include all of the provided paths in the backup, but only
the first one will be used for communication with the daemon.
--tables=table1,table2,...
Semicolon-separated list of tables that you want to backup.
If you want to backup all, just skip this argument. All the provided tables
are supposed to exist in the Manticore instance you are backing up from,
otherwise the backup will fail.
--compress
Whether the backed up files should be compressed. Not by default.
--restore[=backup]
Restore from --backup-dir. Just --restore lists available backups.
--restore=backup will restore from <--backup-dir>/backup.
--force
Skip versions check on restore and gracefully restore the backup.
--disable-telemetry
Pass this flag in case you want to disable sending anonymized metrics  to Manticore. You can also use environment variable TELEMETRY=0.
--unlock
In rare cases when something goes wrong the tables can be left in
locked state. Using this argument you can unlock them.
--version
Show the current version.
--help
Show this help.
