[93mUsage:[0m
manticore-backup --backup-dir=path/to/backup [OPTIONS]
[92m--backup-dir[0m=[94mpath/to/backup[0m
This is a path to the backup directory where a backup is stored.  The
directory must exist. This argument is required and has no default value.
On each backup run, it will create directory `backup-[datetime]` in the
provided directory and will copy all required tables to it. So the backup-dir
is a container of all your backups, and it's safe to run the script multiple
times.
[93mOPTIONS:[0m
[92m--config[0m=[94mpath/to/manticore.conf[0m
Path to Manticore config. This is optional and in case it's not passed
we use a default one for your operating system. It's used to get the host
and port to talk with the Manticore daemon.
[92m--tables[0m=[94mtable1,table2,...[0m
Semicolon-separated list of tables that you want to backup.
If you want to backup all, just skip this argument. All the provided tables
are supposed to exist in the Manticore instance you are backing up from,
otherwise the backup will fail.
[92m--compress[0m
Whether the backed up files should be compressed. Not by default.
[92m--restore[=backup][0m
Restore from --backup-dir. Just --restore lists available backups.
